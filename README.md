# BAMAZON Store
A digital storefront, similar to Amazon, utilizing Node & MySQL. The app receives customer orders and tracks store inventory sales.

## Installations
MySQL npm package 
Inquirer npm package


## Usage

* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
